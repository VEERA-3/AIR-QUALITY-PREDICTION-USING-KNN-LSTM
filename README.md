# INTRODUCTION 
Air pollution has emerged as a significant global challenge, with adverse implications for human health, the environment, and overall well-being. As urbanization and industrialization continue to escalate, the need for effective air quality management becomes imperative. This, titled "Air Quality Prediction Using KNN and LSTM," seeks to address this critical issue by harnessing the power of advanced computational models to forecast air quality levels.The project recognizes the intricate interplay of various factors contributing to air pollution, including pollutant concentrations, meteorological conditions,and geographical features. Traditional methods of air quality prediction often struggle to capture the complexity of these relationships.
